# Code-Refactor

## Horiseon Website

<p>
The Horiseon Website was refactored to include alt attributes on all images and fix broken links on nav bar so that the page jumps down to corresponding sections when clicked
</p>

<p>
The source code for the website was put into semantic order and classes were consolidated
<p>

<div>
<img source = "Horiseon Webpage Screenshot.jpg" alt= "Screenshot of Horiseon Webpage">
</div>
