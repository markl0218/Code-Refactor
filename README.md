# Code-Refactor

## Horiseon Website

<p>
The Horiseon Website was refactored to include alt attributes on all images and fix broken links on nav bar so that the page jumps down to corresponding sections when clicked
</p>

<p>
The source code for the website was put into semantic order and classes were consolidated
